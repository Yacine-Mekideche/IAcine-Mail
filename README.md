## Introduction
Daily email management can quickly become a tedious task, turning our inbox into a cluttered and disorganized space.
Many of us dream of an empty inbox at the end of the day, but it often seems out of reach.

It is from this frustration that the idea of â€‹â€‹creating IAcine_mail was born: an intelligent assistant designed to relieve you of the management of your emails.
With IAcine_mail, the generated responses are automatically stored in your drafts, giving you full control over their final sending.

This process significantly reduces your mental load and the time wasted on repetitive tasks.

Inspired by automation SaaS like Make, I decided to create an open-source tool based on a single Python script.
This approach not only offers a real challenge, but it also allows for greater customization, control, and independence compared to using a paid SaaS.

- Test sending an email:


If no new email is received, the script will inform you:

We will proceed to send a test email from another Gmail account:

After sending it, and receiving it on our mailbox :

When an email is received, the script generates a reply automatically and stores it in your drafts.

- Check the replies in your drafts, edit if necessary, then send :

## Conclusion

The response generated is of high quality and completely consistent with the result achieved if I had spent long minutes having to respond to this test email.

IAcine_mail is designed to simplify the management of your emails by automating the generation of responses. You only have to validate them before sending them, which allows you to stay organized while saving time.
